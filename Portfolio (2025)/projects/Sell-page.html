          <h2 class="goal-title">QUICK SUMMARY</h2>
          <p class="goal-body">I led the UX design of a dedicated landing experience for first-time sellers arriving from paid campaigns, improving conversion rates and user confidence by introducing trust-building content upfront in the sell journey.
          </p>

          <p class="goal-body">New users were being directed straight to the quote form with no context, leading to low engagement, trust gaps, and increased drop-off. We saw this as a clear opportunity to reshape the entry point and improve cost efficiency and conversion across key acquisition channels.

          </p>

          <p class="goal-body">This was a highly collaborative project across product, performance marketing, research, and design. We paired qualitative insights with behavioural data to shape the new flow and validated its impact through an A/B test across UK and US markets.
          </p>

          <p class="goal-body">The new experience introduced persuasive messaging, selling process transparency, and a clearer value proposition — creating a more confident and informed user journey.

              THE GOAL
          </p>

          <p class="goal-body">
            Establish trust with first-time sellers entering via paid media by crafting a high-performing entry-point experience that educates, reassures, and drives engagement with MPB’s selling flow. Ultimately improving quote conversion and reducing customer acquisition costs.
          </p>

          <p class="goal-title">
              THE PROBLEM
          </p>

          <p class="goal-body">
            MPB’s existing flow funnelled paid media traffic directly into a quote form, which was an abrupt and highly transactional step. With no contextual information, onboarding, or reassurance, new users often disengaged due to low trust, an unclear value proposition, and friction in the decision-making process. This resulted in high drop-off rates, reduced cost efficiency across channels, and missed revenue opportunities from high-intent, first-time sellers.
          </p>

          <h4 class="goal-title">

            HYPOTHESIS
           </h4>
           <p class="goal-body">
            We hypothesised that creating a dedicated, trust-building landing page for new sellers would improve conversion performance by providing upfront clarity and reassurance about MPB’s value, process, and credibility.

            To validate this, we ran an A/B test comparing two acquisition journeys. One directed users straight to the quote form, reflecting the existing flow, while the other introduced a newly designed landing page. We anticipated that the new experience would boost user confidence, lead to higher quote submissions, improve engagement, and reduce the cost per acquisition.
