## Important: Never auto-push

**NEVER push to GitHub without the user's explicit permission.** Always wait for the user to say "push" or similar before running `git push`. This applies to all sessions.

You may:
- Stage and commit locally without asking
- Run builds and tests without asking

You must NOT:
- Run `git push` unless the user explicitly requests it
